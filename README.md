# ruby-rails-service-oriented-app

A simple example of Ruby on Rails app with several services, deployed into Docker host or Kubernetes

# Get started

**1. Copy/rename the example-rename-to.env to .env:** Since the .env files won't be uploaded to the GitHub repo for security reasons, you need to rename the Copy/rename that file for your own .env file.

# Deployment to Docker host
Check the commands at the file:

**commands for docker compose.txt**

# Deployment to Kubernetes

There are two options for Kubernetes deployment in this app:
- A. Deployment using KUBECTL and .YAML deployment files.

    **/k8s/helm/Commands to deploy with KUBECTL.txt**


- B. Deployment using HELM and CHART deployment files.
